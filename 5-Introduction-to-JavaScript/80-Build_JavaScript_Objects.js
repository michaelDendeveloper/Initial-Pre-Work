/* I learned to create objects in javaScript.  The data in objects is accessed through properties, which is how they differ from arrays, where data are accessed through indexes.  Objects are useful for representing real world objects that have recordable attributes, such as cats and dogs.  Objects can contain numbers and strings.

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
"name":"fido",
"legs": 4,
"tails": 1,
"friends":["Camper"]
