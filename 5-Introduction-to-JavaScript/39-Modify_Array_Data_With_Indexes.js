/* Example I learned that the entries of arrays are mutable, which means that they can be changed freely.  To keep the code easy to read, it is best practice to use square brackets without a space between the name and the square brackets.
*/
var ourArray = [18,64,99];
ourArray[1] = 45; // ourArray now equals [18,45,99].

// Setup
var myArray = [18,64,99];

// Only change code below this line.
