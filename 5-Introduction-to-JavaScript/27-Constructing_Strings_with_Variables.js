// Example. I learned that I can use a string variable with concatenation operators to combine strings
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Michael";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
